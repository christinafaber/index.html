    <p><b>An Original Poem by Christina Faber</b></p>

    <p>
      Here I stand in the aisle of Goodwill<br />
      that houses the collection of glassware.<br />
      Your bare simplicity attracts my eye, as I’ve been<br />
      looking for a vessel to hold my treasures.<br />
      I take hold of the firm body you possess and wrap<br />
      my lingering fingers around the curvature of<br />
      you. <br />
      I already imagine how I can fill you <br />
      with the things I own;<br />
      <i>that</i> would fulfill your purpose.<br />
    </p>

    <p>
      Turning away from the glasswork and towards the rear of the store,<br />
      I raise you to the beams of light that peek through<br />
      the dusty floor-to-ceiling window,<br />
      searching for potential imperfections in your presence.<br />
      It is late afternoon — the bellowing beacon of light in the sky<br />
      is visible enough to pool its energy in our direction. <br />
    </p>

    <p>
      I hold you up higher towards the influence of the sun;<br />
      as I came across your place on these shelves, I noticed that<br />
      her rays cast a warm and welcoming light<br />
      onto your surface. <br />
      I wonder; what would occur<br />
      if more of her light touched the delicacy of your foundation?<br />
    </p>

    <p>
      You allow the sun to seep through your transparent glass <br />
      and reflect a rainbow onto the concrete floor.<br />
      The two of you make a great team;<br />
      one provides the energy<br />
      and the other interprets the light.<br />
    </p>

    <p>
      I turn my back towards the sun, still grasping on to<br />
      your fragile frame. <br />
      Now that your partner is absent, now that the<br />
      glow-giver is gone, I assume<br />
      you have no power of your own. I suppose<br />
      the magnificent sun holds all the strength, as you seem so<br />
      fragile, so<br />
      delicate, so<br />
      dependent. <br />
    </p>

    <p>
      My shadow covers your body;<br />
      your purpose is to be a vessel, <br />
      one that holds contents and containment.<br />
      With the sun gone and your vase empty,<br />
      are you worth anything on your own?<br />
    </p>

    <p>

    </p>

    <p>
      You are so much more.<br />
      You and the sun complement each other well, but her radiance<br />
      does not construct or define you.<br />
      Instead, you take what she offers<br />
      and turn it into something that is yours.<br />
      You are the one who guides her light. <br />
    </p>

    <p>
      So many will pass you by,<br />
      deeming you unnecessary because of your absence of contents<br />
      and visible light.<br />
      But if they come closer, they will see that your simplicity<br />
      is your strength.<br />
      Your source of brilliance never came from the shining sun;<br />
      she only emphasized what was already there. <br />
    </p>

    <p>
      I used to think that you were precious in the way<br />
      you allowed the light to define your beauty,<br />
      to give your emptiness a purpose.<br />
      But I now know you were beautiful<br />
      before the sun ever graced herself with your touch,<br />
      before she ever diffracted her light off your body.<br />
    </p>

    <p>
      In a way, you create your luminosity.<br />
      Not because you are the source of light, but because<br />
      you shine despite the absence of it.<br />
      You were never truly empty, were you?<br />
      Maybe I could learn a thing or two.<br />
